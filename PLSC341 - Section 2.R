# This section, we're still going to be working with the replication data from
# Lauren Young's 2018 paper "The psychology of state repression: Fear and
# dissent decisions in Zimbabwe."

# I am going to have you form into small groups of 2 or 3 to explore the dataset
# a bit more. In particular, try to do the following:

# 1) Read the paper, download the dataset directly from Harvard Dataverse
# (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UNNCTR),
# explore the contents of the zip file a bit, and read the data into R.

# 2) Choose one or two covariates to explore in greater depth (please don't use
# the ones we talked about in section last week). Make a plot for each covariate
# to show that covariate's distribution. For the continuous covariate, calculate
# the mean and two variances: First, write a function for the plug-in sample
# variance formula given in lecture and use it to calculate the sample variance.
# Then, use the built-in R function var() to calculate the variance of the
# covariate vector.

# 3) Time allowing: Also write a function for the unbiased sample variance and
# compare the result to the other two variances. And/or try to calculate the 
# regression for the treatment outcome that we ran in section last week with the 
# covariates you've explored and without weights. 

# 4) Be prepared to come back and discuss what you found with the class.
